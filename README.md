File Integrity Kit (FIK) Wiki - FIKWiki

We all need a secure way to take notes and lengthy ones at that.
FIKWiki is:
- a cross-platform text document editor (hopefully with all the bells and whistles)
- that has a logged version history (diff only)
- that syncs with your other online versions (if you desire)
- that provides a File Integrity Check on each run and sync
- and that can stand-alone or be webserved, simply.
